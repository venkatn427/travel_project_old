            <h3>Jog Falls- Shimoga</h3>
            <p>Jog Falls are unique as the water does not stream down the rocks in a tiered fashion; it thunders down the slope losing contact with the rocks, making it the tallest un-tiered waterfall in India. The beauty of the waterfalls is enhanced by the lush green surroundings, which provide a scenic backdrop.
                Also known by alternative names of Gerusoppe Falls, Gersoppa Falls, and Jogada Gundi. </p>
