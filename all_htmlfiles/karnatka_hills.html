            <h3>Himavad Gopalaswamy Betta-Chamarajanagar </h3>
            <p> Betta is covered in mist for most of the year, so the first part of the name is Himavad, which means mist. The Shri Himavad Gopalaswamy Temple, established seven centuries ago and is known for its gorgeous views, was once known as South Govardhanagiri and Kamalachala. The temple is at 4770 feet above sea level.
                It has been also referred to as Dakshina Govardhanagiri. The summit of the hill appears to be enveloped by clouds
                and mist, and hence the name Himavad Gopalaswamy Betta (Himavad means covered in mist).
